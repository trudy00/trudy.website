    <h2>tacos</h2>
    <p>Why tacos are the perfect food?
	
They are portable and easy to eat

You can ditch your forks and knives when it comes to tacos. Oh, and, lets not forget that eating off a plate isn't necessary either.
 You can eat tacos just about anywhere. In your home, in the car, on your desk, just so long as you don't leave a mess (easier said than done!).</p>

  <div class="w3-third">
    <h2>burger</h2>
    <p>What makes a burger perfect?
The bite of the burger should be soft and moist, yet it should not fall apart and disintegrate in your hands. The burger meat should have some springy bounce. Burger that lacks this texture feels like you're eating an old tire. 
Blending different grades of ground beef influences the burger's texture</p>

  <div class="w3-third">
    <h2>pizza</h2>
    <p>Pizza is packed with protein
Thanks to all of that melty, mouth-watering cheese, a single slice of pizza contains about 15 grams of protein, which not only gives you energy, but also helps your body repair cells and build big strong muscles. 
So if you're hitting the gym hard, a few slices make the perfect cheat meal.</p>
